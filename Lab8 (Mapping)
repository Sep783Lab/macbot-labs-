## Objectives
The objective of this laboratory session is to gain proficiency in utilizing OpenSLAM's GMapping algorithm for processing continuous
LiDAR point cloud data within a simulated environment using Gazebo and RVIZ. Through this exercise, participants will learn the intricacies
of integrating LiDAR data into a mapping algorithm, understanding the parameters involved in the GMapping algorithm, and visualizing the
mapping results in RVIZ. This hands-on experience aims to enhance understanding and practical skills in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping) techniques, crucial for various robotic applications and autonomous systems.
