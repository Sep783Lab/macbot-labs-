## Objectives
The objective of this laboratory session is to gain proficiency in utilizing OpenSLAM's GMapping algorithm for processing continuous
LiDAR point cloud data within a simulated environment using Gazebo and RVIZ. Through this exercise, participants will learn the intricacies
of integrating LiDAR data into a mapping algorithm, understanding the parameters involved in the GMapping algorithm, and visualizing the
mapping results in RVIZ. This hands-on experience aims to enhance understanding and practical skills in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping) techniques, crucial for various robotic applications and autonomous systems.


## Terminator as MacBot Application Launcher
Install the terminator application. The Terminator application in Ubuntu is a versatile and powerful terminal emulator that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides features such as tabbed terminals, split terminals, customizable key bindings, and the ability to save and restore terminal layouts. Terminator enhances productivity by enabling users to work with different command-line interfaces simultaneously, facilitating efficient multitasking and organization of terminal workflows.. The application program lets you use multiple splitted and resized terminals, all at once on a single screen
```bash
sudo apt -y install terminator
```

## Gazebo and Unified Robot Description Format
Gazebo is a ROS graphical simulation tool. It includes packages to aid in the simulation of forces and physics including gravity, torque, etc. Gazebo brings a fresh approach to simulation with a complete toolbox of development libraries and cloud services to make simulation easy. Iterate fast on your new physical designs in realistic environments with high fidelity sensors streams. Test control strategies in safety, and take advantage of simulation in continuous integration tests. In Gazebo, the URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file plays a central role in defining the physical characteristics and kinematic structure of a robot model used for simulation.

URDF stands for Unified Robot Description Format (http://wiki.ros.org/urdf). It is an XML-based file format used in ROS (Robot Operating System) to describe the physical and kinematic properties of robots, including their geometry, joints, sensors, and other attributes. URDF files play a crucial role in robot modeling, simulation, and visualization within the ROS ecosystem. Here are the key components typically found in a URDF file:

- Robot Model: The URDF file contains the geometric description of the robot, including links (visual and collision properties) and their respective transformations.

- Joints: Joints define the kinematic structure of the robot, specifying how links are connected and how they can move relative to each other. URDF supports various joint types such as revolute, continuous, prismatic, fixed, etc.

- Inertial Properties: URDF files include inertial properties for each link, such as mass, inertia matrix, and center of mass. These properties are essential for simulating the dynamics of the robot accurately.

- Visual and Collision Geometry: Each link in the URDF file can have both visual and collision geometry. Visual geometry defines the appearance of the link in visualizations, while collision geometry is used for collision detection in simulations.

- Sensors: URDF files can also describe sensors attached to the robot, such as cameras, lidars, IMUs, etc. Sensor parameters such as field of view, resolution, and noise characteristics can be specified.

- Transmission and Actuators (optional): For robots with actuators, URDF files may include transmission tags to define how joint movements are translated into actuator commands. This is useful for simulating actuated joints accurately.

- Robot Description: The complete URDF file provides a comprehensive description of the robot's physical properties, kinematics, dynamics, and sensor configurations. This information is crucial for various robotics applications, including simulation, motion planning, and control.

  Here is of an example of two links robot:

    ```xml

    ```
The URDF file (robot_textured.xacro) of the Macbot is located here: `~/macbot/macbot_ws/src/macbot_ros/macbot_description/urdf`.

```bash
gedit  ~/macbot/macbot_ws/src/macbot_ros/macbot_description/urdf/robot_textured.xacro
```

1. In the top left terminal emulator, launch ROSCore. Ensure it launches before proceeding.
```bash
    roscore
```

2. In the bottom left terminal emulator, launch the following file (`~/macbot/macbot_ws/src/macbot_ros/macbot_gazebo/launch/default.launch`). Ensure that it launches successfully before proceeding.
```bash
    roslaunch macbot_gazebo default.launch 
```

This launch file utilizes the URDF format to generate the robot model in Gazebo. You can examine the model's structure in the left column for further details.

This launch file also launches the RViz application with the robot model, including a lidar sensor.

3. Close RViz and Gazebo (File\Quit). Terminate the launch node using Terminator ( CTL+x and CTL+c). Then, launch Gazebo with a 'maze' environment by running:
  
```bash
    roslaunch macbot_gazebo default.launch world:=maze 
```
This launch file include 'maze' world to the model in Gazebo.

Look in RViz that the laser scanner (LiDAR) is scanning the environment in front of the robot.

4. Close RViz and Gazebo (File\Quit). Terminate the launch node using Terminator ( CTL+x and CTL+c). Then, launch Gazebo with a 'maze' environment and RVIZ for mapping:

```bash
    roslaunch macbot_gazebo default.launch world:=maze rviz_config:=mapping
```

This will load the RVIZ in wireframe to use less memory for rendering. Notice that your RVIZ visualization data are in an error state. This is because RVIZ isnâ€™t yet being provided with simulated point-cloud data.

```bash
    roslaunch macbot_gazebo default.launch world:=maze rviz_config:=mapping
