## Objectives
The objective of this laboratory session is to gain proficiency in utilizing OpenSLAM's GMapping algorithm for processing continuous
LiDAR point cloud data within a simulated environment using Gazebo and RVIZ. Through this exercise, participants will learn the intricacies
of integrating LiDAR data into a mapping algorithm, understanding the parameters involved in the GMapping algorithm, and visualizing the
mapping results in RVIZ. This hands-on experience aims to enhance understanding and practical skills in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping) techniques, crucial for various robotic applications and autonomous systems.


## Terminator as MacBot Application Launcher
Install the terminator application. The Terminator application in Ubuntu is a versatile and powerful terminal emulator that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides features such as tabbed terminals, split terminals, customizable key bindings, and the ability to save and restore terminal layouts. Terminator enhances productivity by enabling users to work with different command-line interfaces simultaneously, facilitating efficient multitasking and organization of terminal workflows.. The application program lets you use multiple splitted and resized terminals, all at once on a single screen
```bash
sudo apt -y install terminator
```

Terminator is in the System Tools:

You can also call it from another terminal

## Launch Environment and Gazebo
Gazebo is a ROS graphical simulation tool. It includes packages to aid in the simulation of forces and physics including gravity, torque, etc. Gazebo brings a fresh approach to simulation with a complete toolbox of development libraries and cloud services to make simulation easy. Iterate fast on your new physical designs in realistic environments with high fidelity sensors streams. Test control strategies in safety, and take advantage of simulation in continuous integration tests. SDF is used to specify the contents of simulation, see more information here : http://sdformat.org/tutorials.
SDFormat (Simulation Description Format), sometimes abbreviated as SDF, is an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot simulators, visualization, and control. Originally developed as part of the Gazebo robot simulator, SDFormat was designed with scientific robot applications in mind. Over the years, SDFormat has become a stable, robust, and extensible format capable of describing all aspects of robots, static and dynamic objects, lighting, terrain, and even physics. You can use sdformat.org to create robot and environments. The environment and Macbot model have already been created for you.
